          Wind me up <br />
          Put me down <br />
          Start me off and watch me go<br />
          I'll be running circles around you sooner than you know<br />
          A little off center<br />
          And I'm out of tune<br />
          Just kicking this can along the avenue<br />
          But I'm alright<br />
          <br />
          Coz it's easy once you know how it's done<br />
          You can't stop now<br />
          It's already begun<br />
          You feel it<br />
          Running through your bones<br />
          <br />
          And you jerk it out<br />
          And you jerk it out<br />
          <br />
          Shut up<br />
          Hush your mouth<br />
          Can't you hear you talk too loud<br />
          No I can't hear nothing cause I got my head up in the clouds<br />
          I bite off anything that I can chew<br />
          I'm chasing cars up and down the avenue<br />
          But that's ok<br />

          Coz it's easy once you know how it's done<br />
          You can't stop now<br />
          It's already begun<br />
          You feel it<br />
          Running through your bones<br />
          <br />
          So you jerk it out<br />

          Coz it's easy once you know how it's done<br />
          You can't stop now<br />
          It's already begun<br />
          You feel it<br />
          Running through your bones<br />
          <br />
          And you jerk it out<br />
          And you jerk it out<br />
          And you jerk it out<br />
          And you jerk it out<br />
          Oh baby don't you know you really gotta jerk it out<br />
          When you jerk it out baby don't you know you really gotta jerk it
          out<br />
          When you jerk it out baby don't you know you really gotta jerk it
